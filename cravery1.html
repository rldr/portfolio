            <h2>the problem</h2>
            <p>There are many food applications on the market, each providing separate services like food delivery, recipe inspiration, or restaurant reviews. However, as a hungry consumer using such applications, one must always have a specific food desire in mind. To use Yelp, you must have a specific cuisine in mind before searching. To find a recipe online, you need to know what dish to search up. <br><br> But what about those moments when you are craving something sweet, but only have crackers in the pantry? Or those restless evenings of wanting a savory comfort food, but can’t place your finger on what would do the trick? After returning home from a long day at work, or waking up after a night out with no food in the fridge, the last thing a tired mind wants to do is think of how to get some food.

            <h2>user research</h2>
            <p style="padding-bottom:0">To figure out the common eating habits and lifestyle of potential users, I conducted a survey among 20 respondents that assessed how often people have food cravings and what they do to satisfy it, along with frustrations people have towards popular food apps and services.<br>
              The key takeaways from the survey were:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Most people experience food cravings on a weekly basis</li>
              <li>Most people resort to eating out to satisfy their craving</li>
              <li>Most spend some time cooking meals throughout the week</li>
              <li>When looking for or recipes or healthier alternatives, most people use online resources</li>

            <h2>competitive analysis</h2>
            <p>The survey revealed that respondents typically resort to apps like Yelp to research restaurants, and use online search engines for recipes. There are a lot of food related apps on market, but the category is dominated by Yelp as a whole. I analyzed Yelp and two other popular food apps in order to determine what my product would need to provide to users. In my SWOT analysis, I covered the strengths, weaknesses, and potential threats posed by Yelp, Yummly, and Tasty. </p>

          <h2>branding</h2>
          <p>My goal with this product was to create an app that made the task of searching up food fun and easy. I accomplished this through the use of playful iconography, springy graphic design, and fresh color scheme.</p>

            <h2>logo</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>When making an application related to food, it is very easy to incorporate food items in the logo design. While I played with this idea, I found that this product logo was better suited without frivolous elements. Since I focused my time on the overall experience of the product, I kept the logo simple, yet strong, and casual, yet bold.

            <h2>iconography & graphics</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>aka: where the fun began. Incorporating quirky line icons and curvy graphics really made the product come to life. There is a certain stress factor that can come with rifling through pages upon pages of food items on other platforms. The idea with this product is that the cutesy icons coupled with the bounciness of the background shapes alleviate the stress in a way that other platforms don’t.

            <hr>
            <p>The word “craving” is often associated with night time, hence the phrase “late night cravings.” I chose a deep purple as the focal color to commemorate those late nights spent thinking about food. I used varying tones of the purple to liven parts up, and used a range of complementary orange and baby blue tones.</p>
